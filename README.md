Task 1 – Array Implementation and Manipulation (8 Marks)
Objective:
To perform basic array operations (insert, delete, search) and understand memory shifting.
Scenario: You are maintaining a game leaderboard with at most 10 scores.
Tasks:
1. Start with scores [70, 85, 60, 95, 50].
2. Insert 90 at index 2.
3. Delete the score at index 4.
4. Insert 100 at the end.
5. Find the highest and lowest scores.
Task 2- Queue Simulation (8 Marks)
Objective:
To visualize front and rear movement in a queue.
Instructions:
1. Implement a queue of size 5.
2. Perform the following operations:
• enqueue(10)
• enqueue(20)
• enqueue(30)
• dequeue()
• enqueue(40)
• enqueue(50)
• dequeue()
• enqueue(60)
3. Trace the positions of front, rear, and queue contents after every step.
Task 3 – Expression Conversion using Stack (7 marks)
Objective
To implement stack operations for converting infix expressions into postfix and prefix forms.
Write a program to convert an infix expression into postfix and prefix
Requirements
1. Read an infix expression as input.
2. Show the final postfix expression and prefix expression.
Example Expressions to Test
a) A + B * C
b) (A + B) * (C - D)
c) A * (B + C) / D
Task 4 – Linked List Operations (7 marks)
Objective:
To perform insertion and deletion in a doubly linked list.
Instructions:
1. Create a doubly linked list containing:
10 ⇄ 20 ⇄ 30 ⇄ 40
2. Perform and diagram each of the following operations:
o Insert a node at the beginning with data = 5
o Insert a node after 20 with data = 25
o Delete the last node
